# Pazarama iOS Bootcamp - Final Project

## Shopping

It is an e-commerce application. With the help of Firebase, you can register and log in to howling. When you come to the main page, you can view the products as a list. It appears in the application as home page, search and profile tab bar. Page transitions are provided by navigating between tab bars. When you come to the Search tab bar, you can filter by entering the word you want to search. The profile tab bar contains user information.
